## Description

JSON Visualizer is a tool to visualize your JSON data in a tree view by simply pasting the JSON into the provided text area in the left sidebar and the tree view will be displayed beside it. This is a web-based application built using vanilla javascript and SVG.

This project was built because sometimes it is hard to read the JSON data in a text format within this tool, it will help you to visualize the JSON data in a tree view also I wanted to learn more about how to build a tree data structure and how to traverse it.

## Features

- Visualize JSON data in a tree view
- Pan and zoom the tree view
